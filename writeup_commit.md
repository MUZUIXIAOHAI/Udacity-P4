**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook located in "./P4-Solution.ipynb" .  

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

The code for this step is contained in the 4th code cell of the IPython notebook located in "./P4-Solution.ipynb" . 

I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image .  Here's an example of my output for this step.

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warper()`, which appears in the 5th code cell of the IPython notebook.  The `warper()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```python
offset = 10
src = np.float32(
        [[(img_size[0] / 2 - (55 + offset)), img_size[1] / 2 + 100],
        [((img_size[0] / 6) - 10), img_size[1]],
        [(img_size[0] * 5 / 6) + 60, img_size[1]],
        [(img_size[0] / 2 + (55 + offset)), img_size[1] / 2 + 100]])
    dst = np.float32(
        [[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],
        [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],
        [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],
        [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 575, 460      | 320, 0        | 
| 203, 720      | 320, 720      |
| 1127, 720     | 960, 720      |
| 705, 460      | 960, 0        |

I add the offset for adjust the lane line to be parallel.

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

The code for this step is contained in the 6th code cell of the IPython notebook.

First, I add up the effective pixels in the image vertically to get a row of values, then divide them into left and right sides to find the maximum value. Where the maximum value lies is the initial position of the lane lane on either side.Then ,I divide the image's column pixels to 9 windows, count the average position in each window, and adjust the row position of next window, after than,I can find the lane-line pixels. At last , use the `np.polyfit` to  fit the points , and find the line.

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

The code for this step is contained in the 8th code cell of the IPython notebook in the function `measure_curvature_real()` .

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

The code for this step is contained in the 9th code cell of the IPython notebook.

6Here is an example of my result on a test image:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

The program will fail in places where the road surface is uneven.

For such places, find the key frames first, and then see how to extract the correct lane line position. I think it's a good idea to work with the first few frames.
